### How to ask a question
Asking questions effectively can lead to better solutions. Here are some tips:
1. Try to solve the problem independently first. You can search the Google (Bing) and ask the GPT. You may find that you can resolve the problem on your own.
1. Desribe your problem in detail. Provide a detailed explanation of what you're trying to do and the issues you’re facing. For example, if your program meets an error, you should explain the function of the program first. If it's an environment issue, specify the environment you're using first.
